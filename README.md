# Ocular_disease_recognition_system

Welcom to our Ocular_disease_recognition_system project , where cutting-edge technology meets practical application . this project stands at the intersection of image processing  image classification, CNN and Deep learning aiming to provide efficeint prediction of your eye disease .

# 1. Overview and Preprocessing
   
Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) is a structured ophthalmic database of 5,000 patients with age, color fundus photographs from left and right eyes and doctors' diagnostic keywords from doctors.

This dataset is meant to represent ‘‘real-life’’ set of patient information collected by Shanggong Medical Technology Co., Ltd. from different hospitals/medical centers in China. In these institutions, fundus images are captured by various cameras in the market, such as Canon, Zeiss and Kowa, resulting into varied image resolutions. Annotations were labeled by trained human readers with quality control management. They classify patient into eight labels including:

Normal (N),
Diabetes (D),
Glaucoma (G),
Cataract (C),
Age related Macular Degeneration (A),
Hypertension (H),
Pathological Myopia (M),
Other diseases/abnormalities (O)
# 2. Key Features
i) in this dataset have different different eye disease available but i am working on five disease like Normal , Glaucoma , cataract , AGe related Macular Degeneration and other disease 

ii) i tried different different pretrained model and there weights like Vgg16, vgg19,resnet50, inceptionV3 and finally i got that best fit model is inceptionV3
for dataset .

# Why it matters

eye disease recognition system has wied potential across variour type of eye disease domains, beacuse of as we know that eye is most important part of our body ,if some region any person loss their eyes they have to face many issue . 
os by developing an efficient eye disease recognition system , we contribute to the advancement of this technology making it more accesible and reliable
